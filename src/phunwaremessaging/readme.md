```bash
$ sdkbox import phunwaremessaging
```

##Configure your app for push notifications (iOS)

1. Go to [Apple developer portal](https://developer.apple.com) and create a push notification certificate. (See [Push notification tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/123862/push-notifications-tutorial) for detailed instructions)

2. Once it's created, download the push production certificate and add it to Keychain Access. Then,
   from Keychain Access, export both the certificate and key. (Right click to view the Export option)
   as a .p12 and set a password.

3. Now, log on to the Maas Portal, navigate to the app created for your application and update the following.

    - Certificate (.p12): Click the grey ellipses button to upload the Production Push Certificate
      you created on developer.apple.com.
    - Password: The password you setup for the push certificate.
    - Environment: Use Sandbox for debug builds. Use Production environment for production apps and Production Ad-Hoc build.

6. In the MAAS portal, for the newly created Android app, replace the API Key and sender id with the values for ServerKey and SenderId on the Firebase console (under CloudMessaging section)

### JSON Configuration
SDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your `sdkbox_config.json`, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app.

Here is an example of the PhunwareMessaging configuration.
```json
{
    "ios": {
        "PhunwareMessaging":{
            "debug":true,
            "api_id":"1569",
            "access_key":"b49ea8dc7bdc4a056d51e8b72a8f3a575047a4aa",
